# Capstone-Project
Machine Learning Engineer Nano degree's Capstone Project

# Project Overview:
This repo contains all my Capstone Project of Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program. In this project, I have showed how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, my algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed. Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, I have made important design decisions about the user experience for our app. By completing this project, I understood the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline. Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world application often involves solving many problems without a perfect answer.

# Libraries:
1. NumPy
2. OpenCV
3. Matplotlib
4. PyTorch

# CNN to Classify Dog Breeds from Scratch
CNN architecture of trained model attains at least 10% accuracy on the test set.

# CNN to Classify Dog Breeds Using Transfer Learning
Model architecture that uses part of a pre-trained model with accuracy on the test set of 60% or greater.
